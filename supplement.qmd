# A detailed example

Here we include some equations and theorem-like environments to show
how these are labeled in a supplement and can be referenced from the
main text.
Consider the following equation:
$$
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
$$ {#eq-suppa}
You can also reference equations such as [@eq-matrices,@eq-bb] 
from the main article in this supplement.
